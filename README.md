# interviewquestionandanswer---I'll probably try to do most of these in Python (because of its use in machine learning) and C++
# becasuse of its use in competitive programming/hackathons...also: NOTE FOR BEGINNER: if you are hip to sports i would look at
# it like this, Superbowl, World Series, World Cup for soccer, if you saw these events as a kid you would not be discouraged to go
# out and play the game yourself, because those are pro's....so start with easy problems, as they say...and just WIN THE HACKATHON BABY
#  :):):):) ANd its all in the books :):):):):) Peace out!!!!!
